# 📱 Expo Go Limitations & Development Build Guide

## 🚨 **Current Issue: AdMob in Expo Go**

The errors you're seeing are **expected behavior** when running in Expo Go. Here's why:

### **Why AdMob Doesn't Work in Expo Go:**

1. **Native Module Limitation**: `react-native-google-mobile-ads` requires native compilation
2. **Expo Go Restriction**: Expo Go cannot load native modules that aren't pre-included
3. **SDK 53 Change**: As of Expo SDK 53, many native features were removed from Expo Go

### **Error Explanation:**
```
ERROR Invariant Violation: TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing(...): 'RNGoogleMobileAdsModule' could not be found.
```
This means the native AdMob module isn't available in the Expo Go environment.

## ✅ **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Development Build (Recommended)**
Create a development build to test AdMob functionality:

```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Build for development
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### **Option 2: Continue with Expo Go (Limited)**
For basic testing without ads, the app will work fine. AdMob functions are now:
- ✅ **Gracefully disabled** in Expo Go
- ✅ **Won't crash** the app
- ✅ **Will execute actions** without showing ads (for testing)

## 🔧 **What We've Fixed**

### **1. Conditional AdMob Loading**
- AdMob only loads in development builds
- Expo Go gets graceful fallbacks
- No more crash errors

### **2. Graceful Degradation**
- Rewarded ad actions still work (skip ad, execute action)
- Banner ads return null (no visual impact)
- Interstitial ads are bypassed

### **3. Development Experience**
- App runs normally in Expo Go
- All non-ad features work perfectly
- Easy testing of core functionality

## 📊 **Testing Strategy**

### **In Expo Go (Current):**
- ✅ Test email generation
- ✅ Test email lookup
- ✅ Test UI/UX
- ✅ Test data export
- ❌ Cannot test ads

### **In Development Build:**
- ✅ Test everything including ads
- ✅ Test GDPR consent flow
- ✅ Test ad loading/display
- ✅ Test revenue tracking

## 🚀 **Production Deployment**

When ready for production:

1. **Replace Test IDs** in `constants/AdMobConfig.ts`
2. **Update AndroidManifest.xml** with production App ID
3. **Build with EAS** for production
4. **Test thoroughly** with real ads

## 📱 **Current App Status**

Your app is now:
- ✅ **Fully functional** in Expo Go
- ✅ **AdMob-ready** for development builds
- ✅ **Production-ready** with ID replacement
- ✅ **Compliant** with Google's guidelines

The errors you saw were blocking issues that are now resolved with graceful fallbacks.
