DOCKER BUILD COMMANDS FOR REACT NATIVE APK
==========================================

1. First, make sure Docker Desktop is running on Windows.

2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator and navigate to your project:
   cd "C:\Users\shiha\Desktop\tronics\temp-mail"

3. Build the Docker image (this will take 15-20 minutes):
   docker build -t temp-mail-builder .

4. Create output directory:
   mkdir build-output

5. Extract APK from container:
   docker run --rm -v "%cd%\build-output:/host-output" temp-mail-builder sh -c "cp /output/*.apk /host-output/"

6. Check the build-output folder for your APK files:
   dir build-output

ALTERNATIVE: Run the batch file directly:
========================================
Just double-click "build-apk.bat" and it will do all steps automatically.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

- If Docker build fails, check Docker Desktop is running
- If permission errors, run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Build process takes 15-20 minutes for first time (downloads Android SDK)
- APK will be around 50-100MB in size

The Docker container includes:
- Ubuntu 22.04
- Node.js 18
- Java 11 (OpenJDK)
- Android SDK with API 33 & 34
